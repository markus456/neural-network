neural-network
==============

A demonstration on different ways to train neural networks. The BodyHammer project uses a packpropagation method to train a neural network to recognize a small set of test symbols and demonstrates a practical use for neural networks. The Tetsuo project uses a genetic algorithm to define the fitness of each 'creature' and by natural selection, optimizes the neural network.
